          <h2><span>HISTORY</span></h2>
          <p>
            According to author J. J. Roy Burman, Banjaras have settled across
            Rajasthan and other parts of India. Together with the Bhopa, Domba
            and Kalbelia, they are sometimes called the "Gypsies of India".
            Professor D. B. Naik says that, "There are so many cultural
            similarities in the Roma Gypsies and the Banjara Lambanis". Author
            B. G. Halbar says that, Most of nomadic communities believe that
            they are descended from Rajput ancestry. All these nomadic tribal
            groups who claim Rajput ancestry says that during the time of Mughal
            domination they were retreated to the forests and vowed to return
            only when the foreign influence had gone. B. G. Halbar says they
            appear to be of mixed ethnicity, possibly originating in
            north-central India. However, Habib notes that their constituent
            groups may not in fact share a common origin, with the theories that
            suggest otherwise reflecting the systemic bias of nineteenth-century
            British ethnographers who were keen to create simple
            classifications. Laxman Satya notes that "Their status as Banjaras
            was circumscribed by the colonial state disregarding the rich
            diversity that existed among various groups". Although not referred
            to as Banjara until the sixteenth century, Habib believes that the
            royal court chroniclers Ziauddin Barani and Shaikh Nasiruddin
            documented them operating in the Delhi Sultanate some centuries
            earlier, around the time of the rule of Alauddin Khalji. Halbar
            dates things earlier, suggesting that Dandin, a Sanskrit writer who
            lived in the sixth century, refers to them but, again, not by name.

          <h2><span>CULTURE AND RELIGION</span></h2>
          <p>
            Gour Banjaras have different cultural life and practices that
            differentiate them from others. They also have their own language,
            food habits, body tattooing, dress and ornaments, art , Martial art,
            Gorilla fighting skill, 'Ghumar' dance, and festivals and
            ceremonies, which have formed their culture. Gor Banjara culture
            includes their language, costume, marriage customs, festivities,
            folk and performing arts, and many other capabilities acquired by
            them. Their culture with its language and professions seems distinct
            and different from other tribes. Gour Banjara culture is known as
            Rajputana culture. They have their own language called ‘Banjara’,'
            Brinjari' or ‘Gormati’ and a different and distinct culture of their
            own.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of the Banjara people profess faith in Hinduism and follow Hindu
            culture. They are known to worship deities such as Balaji, Goddess
            Jagadamba Devi, Goddess Bhavani, Renuka Mata of Mahur and
            Hanuman.[citation needed] They also hold Guru Nanak in great
            respect. However, the Banjaras have been "ambiguous" with regard to
            religion and were "tolerant and syncretic", according to Satya. He
            notes, like Habib, that some banjaras those who had settled in the
            Wun district of Berar must have annoyed local Brahmins by preferring
            to use the services of their own priests rather than of that
            priestly caste. Further, they were associated with the Mahanubhava
            sect which led to a belief in Krishna and "a casual attitude towards
            cohabitation". Sevalal or Sevabhaya is the most important saint of
            the Banjaras. According to their accounts, he was born on 15
            February 1739 and died on 4 December 1806. A cattle merchant by
            profession he is said to have been a man of exemplary truthfulness,
            a great musician, a courageous warrior, a rationalist who fought
            against superstition and a devotee of the goddess Jagadamba. The
            colonial British administrators also quote his stories but they
            place him in the 19th century and identify his original name as Siva
            Rathor. The tribe has evolved and more people in the tribe started
            following natural religions. This is due to invasions, colonisation
            and partition of India. There Muslim Banjara mainly in Sindh region
            of Pakistan. Some Banjara people became Laban started following
            Sikhism. After the British Raj and independence Christianity entered
            into the Banjara culture by missionaries. But, majority of the
            Banjara community follow their own independent customs and Hindu
            religion.

          <h2><span>LANGUAGE</span></h2>
          <p>
            Banjaras speak Gour Boli; also called Banjara, Banjary it belongs to
            the Indo-Aryan group of languages. As Banjara, Lambadi has no
            script, it is either written in Devanagari script or in the script
            of the local language such as Telugu or Kannada. Many Banjaras today
            are bilingual or multilingual, adopting the predominant language of
            their surroundings, but those that continue to live in areas of
            dense Banjara population persist with their traditional language. "
            Kesula Nai Mora ri, Maayad Bhasha Banjara ri. Chanda Suryasyu Amraa
            ri, Jeeve Jeevesyu Pyari." (Banjara is my mother tongue. Blooming
            like a flowers. She is immortal like the Moon and the Sun. She is
            dearer to us than life.) This is considered the pride song of
            Banjara language. This popular composition of Eknath Pawar- Nayak
            (Maharashtra)an expert in Banjara language, literature and culture.
            many MPs have also demanded in Parliament the status of Banjara
            language. MP Umesh Jadhav, MP Suresh Dhanorkar, former MP Harisingh
            Rathour, Rajeev Satav, etc. demanded in Parliament to include
            Banjara language in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.
            Telangana state has introduced two textbooks in Banjara language for
            primary school children in 1,426 Tanda's in the State. Gour Banjaras
            have their own mother tongue called ‘Gorboli’, Banjary and it is
            spoken by people living across India. According to their names their
            language is also known by various names such as Lamani, Lambadi,
            Lambani, Brinjari, Gourmati, Banjara, Lubhani and variants. Regional
            dialects are divided between the Banjaras of MH (written in Marathi
            and Hindi by using Devanagari script), KK (written in the Kannada
            script), AP and TS (written in the Telugu script). They are
            bilingual and speak in Hindi or Marathi or Kannada or Telugu along
            with their mother tongue ‘Gorboli’, but there is an influence of
            regional languages on their ‘Banjaras’ language. As such the actual
            number of ‘Gorboli Banjara’ speakers is not known since the census
            is not being enumerated based on language for the last many years.
